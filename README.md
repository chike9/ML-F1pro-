# 🤖 Build Your Own GPT in 30 Minutes

> Learn how to create a GPT-like AI from scratch - explained simply enough for a 5-year-old, but powerful like a 30-year MIT expert!

## 🔥 What You'll Learn

In just 30 minutes, this tutorial will teach you:

1. **What is GPT and how it works** (super simple explanation!)
2. **The essential ingredients** you need to build one
3. **How to build a tiny GPT-like model** step by step
4. **Where to go next** for real-world applications
5. **Bonus: Make it talk like ChatGPT**

## 🧠 What is GPT? (The 5-Year-Old Explanation)

Think of GPT as a **super smart parrot** that:
- Read a **huge number of books, websites, and conversations**
- Now **guesses what word comes next**, one by one, really fast

### Example:
```
🧩 You say: "Once upon a..."
🤖 GPT says: "time."
Then: "there..."
Then: "was..."
```
It keeps going based on everything it learned!

## 🧪 Essential Ingredients

You need these 5 key components:

| Ingredient | What it Does |
|------------|--------------|
| 🧠 **Data** | Texts (books, code, chats) |
| 🏗️ **Model** | A brain (neural net) that learns from text |
| 🧮 **Training** | Math to help the model learn patterns |
| 💻 **GPU** | Fast computer chip to train it |
| 🔁 **Code** | To put it all together (Python + PyTorch/TF) |

## 🛠️ Quick Start: Build MiniGPT in 10 Steps

> **Note:** You won't train GPT-4 (needs billions of $$$), but you can build **MiniGPT** today!

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install torch transformers datasets
```

### Step 1: Get Training Data

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load tiny Shakespeare dataset (100 KB)
data = load_dataset("tiny_shakespeare")['train']['text'][0]
```

### Step 2: Tokenize the Text

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
tokens = tokenizer.encode(data, return_tensors="pt")
```

### Step 3: Load a Pre-trained Model

```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel

model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")
model.eval()
```

### Step 4: Generate Text

```python
# Generate text from your MiniGPT
output = model.generate(tokens[:, :20], max_new_tokens=50)
print(tokenizer.decode(output[0]))
```

**Boom 💥 — Your MiniGPT is speaking!**

## 🚀 Training Your Own GPT

**⚠️ Warning:** Real training is expensive! But here's the concept:

### Basic Training Pipeline

```python
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

# Set up training parameters
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./model",
    per_device_train_batch_size=2,
    num_train_epochs=1
)

# Initialize trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=your_dataset
)

# Start training
trainer.train()
```

## 🧙 Make It Talk Like ChatGPT

Want conversational responses? Use **prompt engineering**:

```python
# Create a conversational prompt
prompt = "User: How are you?\nAI:"
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors="pt")

# Generate response
output = model.generate(input_ids, max_new_tokens=50)
response = tokenizer.decode(output[0])
print(response)
```
